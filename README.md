# Fantasy_SCOTUS
Python project scraping web results and using the Google API to manage a Fantasy SCOTUS League

# Requirements
Works with [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/bs4/doc/) and the [Google Sheets API](https://developers.google.com/sheets/api/). To get running, you need to install the former. To do this on Linux or Mac systems (with Python 3), use:
```
apt-get install python3-bs4
```

If you're working on a Mac and get an `urlopen error [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED]`, you need to navigate to `Applications > Python 3.x` and double click on "Install Certificates.command"
